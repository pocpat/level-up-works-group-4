# level-up-works-group-4
This project aimed to develop a set of application pages based on the design of the application prototype. As part of the project team, my assigned task was to create the Home page and Login page.

This project was developed as part of Full-Stack Development studies, serving as a practical implementation to explore and apply various concepts and technologies.

The page does not require any content from a database.

New users can sign up by providing their name, email, and hashed password, which are validated for uniqueness. Existing users can log in using their credentials. Successful logins display a warm "Welcome back, [user's name]!" message, while incorrect email, name, or password entries trigger specific error messages.  |
